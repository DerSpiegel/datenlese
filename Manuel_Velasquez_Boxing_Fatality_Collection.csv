Tyne was convicted of manslaughter, and fined one shilling. The Prince Regent, the future King George IV, was present at the bout. Like the other spectators, the Prince quickly left the scene. To reduce the ensuing scandal, in 1789, the Prince awarded an annuity of œ20 to Earle's mother. This chain of events apparently inspired the rhyme, ""Georgie Porgie, puddin' and pie/Kissed the girls and made them cry/When the boys came out to play/Georgie Porgie ran away."" The explanation is this. George was notoriously fat; hence, he had eaten too many puddings and pies. From 1782 to 1803, George's mistresses included Frances Twysden Villiers, wife of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey. George's wives (Caroline, from whom he was separated, and Maria Fitzherbert, to whom George had married in a civil ceremony) were unhappy about George's relationship with Frances Villiers. Thus, the rhyme's line about making the girls cry, and also the rhyme's subsequent association with the seventeenth century dukes of Buckingham, both of whom were named George Villiers, same as Lady Jersey's husband. Finally, when the boys came out to play (that is, box) and Earle died, the Prince Regent ran away."; ;Pro;Brain injury;Ring;Fall: Manslaughter; ;

Grant, 1906), 17. The fight lasted about an hour. Smith was knocked out by a blow to the ear. Cause of death was attributed to congestion of the brain. Around this time, pugilism began falling out of favor with the British aristocracy. One reason was a scandal over betting that caused the retirement of Gentleman John Jackson, a man widely viewed as an honest broker. Another was the well-publicized trial and execution of a homicidal boxing promoter named John Thurtell. And a third was the spread of middle-class Christian evangelicalism. To the Christian reformers, pugilism gave crude pleasure to the rich and the working classes. Moreover, it was associated with homoeroticism, which was an even graver sin. (During the Regency, heroic nudity had been an artistic vogue, and Thomas Bruce, Earl of Elgin, was notorious for paying pugilists to pose nude amidst his Greek marbles.) Thus, new laws were passed -- and more importantly, enforced. The first major fight to be stopped under the new anti-prizefight laws was one between Ned Neale and Jem Burns in 1824. Emigrating to America or Australia was among the ways that fighters avoided such strictures, and in July 1823, the New York Evening Post described a bout between an 18-year old butcher and ""a man they called the champion of Hickory Street."" The stakes in the latter fight were $200, an amount roughly equal to a working man?s annual income. Better known were the battles between Ned Hammond of Dublin and George Kensett of Liverpool in 1824 and 1826. Such battles had strong ethnic overtones, and the practice of tying gang colors to the ropes dates to this era. At the same time, journalists such as Pierce Egan, author of Boxiana, or Sketches of Ancient and Modern Pugilism, began promoting the heroics of the old days, and newspapers such as the New York Herald began routinely reporting prizefights. Other, less famous, popular boxing texts of 1820s and 1830s included William Sharples's The Complete Art of Boxing (1829),  Samuel O?Rourke?s The Art of Pugilism (1837), and Owen Swift?s Hand-Book to Boxing (1840).

Wood and Cooper had an argument about seating, and they agreed to settle it using prize ring rules. After boxing for about two hours, Cooper was knocked down by a blow to the temple, and he did not get up. His friend James Morrell carried him to his bed.

The fight was with gloves. The venue was William Shaw's Queen's Head Tavern, in Windmill-street, Haymarket. Because prizefighting was illegal, the match was advertised as a ""protracted sparring match."" The bout took place in an upstairs room that was used, alternately, for boxing, rat killing, and cock fighting. About one hundred people were present, and admission was by ticket costing 6 pence. There was a referee and a time-keeper. The publican, Shaw, was in and out of the room all night with drinks. The men  fought for about an hour. In the end, Wilmot either fell or was knocked down. As he fell, he may have struck his head against a post that was in the center of the ring. After getting up, he said did not feel well, and Shaw stopped the fight, saying, ""Now, gents, it's all over."" Wilmot was taken to the hospital, where he died several hours after admission. Cause of death was a rupture of an artery on the right side of the brain. The subsequent court case, R. v. Young, (1866) 10 Cox 371, established the legal precedent that death ""caused by an injury received in a friendly sparring match, which is not a thing likely to cause death... is not manslaughter, unless the parties fight on until the sport becomes dangerous."" (Henry Roscoe, Roscoe's Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases, Eighth American Edition, volume II,  Philadelphia, 1888, p. 912.) Another important distinction of this fight is that it took place in private rooms, and so did not cause a public nuisance.  There had been cases of fence-breaking and illegal timber removal in earlier outdoor prizefights, and after 1860, most British railway companies refused to hire special trains for prizefight excursions. Indeed, the practice of hiring special prizefight trains was specifically prohibited by the Regulation of Railways Act of 1868: ""Any railway company that shall knowingly let for hire any special train for the purpose of conveying parties to be present at any prize fight... shall be liable to a penalty ... of such sum not exceeding five hundred pounds, and not less than two hundred pounds.""

Although Dempsey fought lightweight, he weighed about 114 pounds.  The bout took place in a back room of Red Leary's Live Oak Hotel. Two-ounce gloves were worn, and it was a finish fight fought according to Queensberry Rules. Although billed as lightweights, actual weight was about 115 pounds. The fight was also reportedly a fix, with Dempsey supposed to dive during the fourth. However, during the bout, Dempsey was hit in the temple. He collapsed, and lay on the floor, frothing at the mouth and convulsing, for about twenty minutes. Then he died.  The promoter, Eddie McDonald, told police he didn't know the names of anyone who was there, and the seconds said that death was due either to the fall or to Dempsey being unfit for boxing. Death was attributed to ""shock caused by excitement"" or ""organic derangement."" Besser was about 18 or 19 years of age, and he remained a professional boxer for several years. Besser's wife Minnie also boxed professionally (Chicago Daily Tribune, November 2, 1892)."; ;Pro;Organic derangement;Ring;Misadventure; ;

Water was thrown on him, and he was left to recover while the sports returned to watch Jake Kilrain spar three rounds with Cleary. After that, there was some wrestling.  James still had not recovered by the time the wrestling had ended, so a physician was sought. The physician arrived, but James still died about 11:30 p.m. that night. Cause of death was attributed to the ""great excitement and exertion pending the contest,"" and the principals were released on the grounds that there was no law regarding deaths that occurred in the course of properly licensed exhibitions. Bezenah was touring with William Muldoon and Jake Kilrain. Anyone who lasted 4 rounds with Bezenah got $25, so he specialized in doing fourth-round knockouts.

Seville was subsequently convicted of prizefighting, and sentenced to a year in prison. The conviction was appealed, on the grounds that gloves were worn and Queensberry Rules were followed.

Riordan, who was from Melbourne, Australia, was Fitzsimmons' sparring partner, and he had not boxed competitively since losing to Jack Slavin in June 1892. Thus, Fitzsimmons normally took it easy on Riordan, who was also a heavy drinker. After being told of the death, Fitzsimmons said, ""I knew he had been drinking hard, but did not know he was in such a condition... The blow that caused the trouble was as light as I could make it, I merely slapping him with the back of my hand. He fell down then rose and staggered around... When he fell headlong, I thought he was faking, and was thoroughly disgusted."" The death certificate listed the cause of death as ""hemorrhage within the cranial cavity, causing compression of the brain."" The clot was on the right side of the brain, very deep.  Fitzsimmons was arrested on a charge of manslaughter in the first degree, but  was later acquitted. Fitzsimmons bought the burial plot for Riordan, in Section 51 of Oakwood Cemetery, and helped carry the casket, but no one ever bought Riordan a gravestone.

Winters was a deaf-mute, hence the name. Smith had taken up boxing about two months previously, and the bout was arranged at the last minute, to fill a hole in a card. However, he had fought professionally as recently as four nights before the fatal fight. The rounds were two minutes each, with one minute between them. During the second round, Smith was struck hard on the jaw, and he may have hit his head on the ropes as he fell. He did not answer the bell for the third round, and so the fight was awarded to Winters. Following the fight, Smith's jaw continued to hurt, so he went to the doctor. He was diagnosed with a broken jaw, on the right, near the front. Gangrene set in around a rotten tooth, and Smith died on December 10, 1894. Winters was arrested. Death was attributed to blood poisoning, following a gangrenous condition of the lungs."; ;Pro;Gangrene;Later;Blows: Misadventure; ;

According to the Omaha Daily Bee (February 19, 1899), ""Judge Baker defined what prize fighting is. The laws of Nebraska, he says, do not give a definition. The two instructions following cover the whole case: 'Prize fighting is where two persons fight by agreement, with or without gloves, for a reward or compensations for fighting, to which fighting people are generally invited and admitted as spectators, and when the fighting or contest is of such a kind and character that bodily injury to one or both of the contestants is naturally expected and is a natural result.'"" According to the judge's instructions, if Dupont and Walker were doing this, then the jury should rule guilty of manslaughter in the second degree. However, according to the defense attorney, Mr. Macfarland, a ""mere sparring contest under Marquis of Queensbury rules is not of necessity a prize fight; that to constitute a prize fight, there must be expectation of reward and intent to inflict bodily harm."" The jury went to dinner, then came back and found not guilty of the charge of manslaughter as the result of a prize fight. Promoters of the fight included Thomas Ensor, mayor of South Omaha, and J.E.

The ringside physician diagnosed heart failure, and so injected Turner with strychnine. The doctor from the emergency hospital concurred with the house physician's diagnosis, addint that cause of death was due to exertion. Therefore, despite autopsy showing ruptured vessels on the right side of the brain, the official cause of death was listed as heart failure caused by exertion. The day after the fight, London Times reported that ""a better night's sport could not be wished for"" and the National Sporting Club, where the fight had taken place, said that accidents happened. At trial, defense argued that death resulting from manly sports and exercises was generally held free of liability. True, there had been deaths resulting from fights at the National Sporting Club, but there had also been over 2,000 contests fought there in just seven years.

Although cause of death was brain hemorrhage, the mechanism was attributed to a punch to the solar plexus. (""The solar plexus blow causes unconsciousness by deranging the vagal tone of the body,"" thus decreasing blood pressure, and possibly causing cardiac arrest.

Cohen was a coal passer from USS Yankee, while Johnson was a coal passer on USS Olympia. Cohen was badly beaten in the fight, and died in sick bay early the next morning. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage on the left side of the brain. The following passage comes from Hoster's letter: ""We have been holding prize fights aboard this Ship but I don't think we will have any more on account of one of the Yankee's crew getting killed. The fellows name was Cohen and lived near the Bowery in New York City. The fight was for a knock out and winner take all the money. The lad who killed him is a negro and is one of this ship's crew. The fight was about even untill the eighth round when Johnson the negro gave him a left-swing and sent him to the mat and just about the finishing of the count Cohen got on his feet and Johnson caught him another with his right and knocked him to the mat never to rise any more. He was carried to the sick bay and died at 12 O'clock that night. We are making a purse for his Mother and have got about One Thousand Dollars so far. Johnson is getting a General Court Martial but it will not amount to anything."" Hoster was correct about the court-martial, whose verdict was that Cohen died in line of duty. According to the Daily News article, ""There is hardly a ship in the navy with a sufficiently large crew which does not witness two or three of these bouts each week...

In January 1914, a jury acquitted Willard of the charge of prizefighting, as defined by California statute, and this decision effectively legalized professional boxing in California. The statute (412) and revisions can be read in The Penal Code of the State of California by California and Charles Howard Fairall (Bancroft-Whitney, 1909), 204-206.

The youths were students at Kemper Military School (closed 2002). The match was sanctioned (and supervised) by school officials, for the purpose of resolving a grudge; evidently, Lewis, aged 16, had called the older youth ""Pussy"" Katz. Katz was larger, and did well enough during the first two rounds that Lewis wanted to stop at the end of the second. However, Katz wanted to continue, so the match was allowed to continue into the third round specified for amateur bouts. At the start of the third, before any blows were struck, Katz suddenly fell to the ground. He was pronounced dead 12 minutes later.

The fights were scheduled for five rounds of two minutes each, and eight-ounce gloves were worn. The prize was a trophy. This was a quarterfinal bout; both men had fought earlier in the tournament. The result at the end of five rounds was a draw, so a sixth round was ordered as a tie-breaker. Both men were clearly tired, and at the end of the round, Bellenger was struck in the face while stepping in. He fell backwards, and may have struck his head while falling. He did not get up, so the fight was stopped. Seconds carried Bellenger to his corner, and then transported him to the hospital. He briefly regained consciousness about three hours later, but then went into a coma. He died next day, about two hours after an unsuccessful trepanning operation. Cause of death was basal skull fracture and brain hemorrhage, and attributed to the fall rather than blows. Jury ruled death by misadventure."; ;Amateur;Brain injury;Ring;Fall: Misadventure;;

Anyway, after this hearing, Gustafson's mother, Helma C.Gustafson, went to New York Life Insurance Company to collect on her son's policy. The insurer paid face value of the policy without question, but balked at paying double indemnity for accidental death. So, it was back to court. In this case, the court (District Court, Western District Pennsylvania) ruled in favor of Mrs. Gustafson. First, there was no specific clause in the insurance contract stating specifically that boxing was a prohibited activity. Second, ""no man has ordinarily any cause or reasonable ground to anticipate that when he engages in any of these games, death will result.""

The court case is Shelaeff v. Groves, 27 F. Supp. 1018 - US: Dist. Court, ND California 1939. The decision in this case was to dismiss the complaint: for public officers to be liable for tort, the officers must owe a statutory duty to the injured person. There was no statutory rule about this in the California code. In addition, there was nothing in the complaint indicating that anyone had done anything that was clearly wrong.

This suspension had nothing to do with the fact that Hines had lost 22 of his 23 career fights, 10 by knockout, and had been called in as a last minute substitute. Instead, it was because Eck and Fluck publicly protested the athletic commission having prohibited Eck from fighting while the athletic commission conducted its investigation."; ;Pro;Brain injury;Ring;Misadventure; ;

The bout was on the undercard of the welterweight title fight between Kid Gavilan and Billy Graham. Although Donoghue was leading on points, the contest was fairly even for seven rounds. Then, in the eighth, Flores took a straight right to the mouth followed by a left hook to the chin. Flores hit the floor with an audible thud and the fight was stopped. Flores, visibly dazed, was rushed to the dressing room so that the ring could be prepared for the televised main event, and there he fell into a coma. Despite three surgeries in five days, he died in hospital. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage, but some of the cerebral edema pre-existed the fatal bout. This is not surprising -- Flores had averaged two fights per month for the past 21 months, and he had lost two fights in the past five weeks by technical knockout. Following the autopsy, Flores's wife's family sued the International Boxing Corporation for negligence. In 1957, with the case going to trial, the International Boxing Corporation settled out of court for $30,500 (about $250,000, in today's dollars). In addition, investigations started as the result of this suit directly contributed to the demise of the company itself, as the investigations revealed that the company's practices were monopolistic and represented restraint of trade. The Flores family also sued the State Athletic Commission. In 1955, a New York superior court ruled that the Commission was responsible for the decisions of Commission-approved physicians, and awarded Mrs. Flores $80,000. The Commission appealed this determination, and, in a split decision, the appellate court reversed the lower court's ruling. Taken together, these two suits greatly accelerated the use of foam-padded rings, ropes, and buckles in New York. In addition, the furor caused the State Athletic Commission to rule that boxers take a mandatory 30-day break following knockouts. Of note, however, is the fact that the medical opinion in this case actually said that a boxer should take a 60-90 day break following a knockout. As an aside, Marlon Brando's famous line, ""I could have been a contender,"" is attributed to a post-fight conversation between Donogue and author Budd Schulberg.

This was the first known death of a reigning world champion (Paret) in the ring. Midway through the twelfth round, Griffith hit a flatfooted Paret eighteen times in just six seconds. Paret unsurprisingly slumped unconscious over the ropes, and he died in hospital ten days later. Cause of death was brain injury. The fight was a championship bout broadcast live over national television, so the images of the death were rerun frequently on news shows. In literature, the death resulted in a famous English-language essay, namely Norman Cousins, ""Who killed Benny Paret?"" Saturday Review, 45:14 (May 5, 1962), 14, in which Cousins argued that the bloodlust of the audience was primarily responsible for boxers' deaths. In Spanish, the death also inspired Nicomedes Santa Cruz's equally sardonic ""Muerte en el ring"" (April 12, 1962), in which the poet said, ""Here the only ones who never lose are our managers and the promoter."" Subsequent court cases included Alfaro v. Joint Legislative Com. on Prof. Boxing, 36 Misc. 2d 1018, 234 N.Y.S. 2d 164, in which Paret's former manager, Manuel Alfaro, unsuccessfully tried to quash a subpoena issued by a state legislative inquiry into the ""possibility that many boxers, managers and promoters might be under control of racketeers.""";World;Pro;Brain injury;Ring;Blows: Misadventure; ;

Moore was the 1952 Olympics champion and current world champion, but he had starved himself to make weight. About 45 minutes after the end of the fight, he lapsed into unconsciousness, and he died three days later. Cause of death was attributed to his head striking the ring ropes as he fell.

For instance, Bob Dylan's song ""Who Killed Davey Moore?"" premiered on April 12, 1963; lyrics appear at http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/daveymoore.html.

Cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest secondary to acute subdural hematoma. The widow filed suit for $500 million, and the trials led to two published decisions, namely Classen v. State of New York, 131 Misc. 2d 346 (1985)/500 N.Y.S. 2d 460 (Ct. Cl. 1985) and Classen v. Izquierdo, 137 Misc. 2d 489 (1987)/ 520 N.Y.S. 2d 999 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1987). In the first case, the higher court ruled that there was no malpractice liability for the doctors (one was a pediatrician and the other was a urologist) who had cleared Claasen to fight because the doctors had followed accepted procedures. In the second, the higher court ruled that the ringside physician's duty to an athlete was the same inside the ring as it was inside a hospital or clinic. That is, the doctor needed to follow accepted medical practice. Consequently, a failure to stop a fight on medical grounds could constitute malpractice if it was determined that the decision was contrary to accepted medical practice. The courts' emphasis on accepted procedures and standards was part of the reason for a subsequent New York State Athletic Commission requirement for promoters to have ambulances on site during boxing matches.

The fight was part of the undercard to the first Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran contest, and many fans had not arrived at the stadium. Hart was leading throughout the match, and late in the tenth round, he hit Denny at least four times in rapid succession. Denny collapsed and the referee stopped the fight. Denny lay on the mat, convulsing, but commission doctors failed to respond. Upon realizing that medical aid was not forthcoming, two physicians seated ringside, a family practitioner named Pierre Meunier and a television boxing analyst named Ferdie Pacheco, went through the ropes. ""'It was pretty obvious that Denny had suffered a serious cerebral injury,' says Dr. Meunier, who watched as the boxer was bundled onto a stretcher for transport to nearby Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. Just how serious became infinitely clear the next day, when Denny died without regaining consciousness"" (Cardwell, 2001). The investigations into Denny's death led to the resignation of two doctors from the Montreal Athletic Commission, and to Canadian ring physicians being given the authority to stop a match. The first time that Dr. Meunier, himself a ringside physician, used this power to stop a fight was during a pro contest held in 1984, and the riot that broke out in the stands after the stoppage was announced led to arrests."; ;Pro;Brain injury;Ring;; ;

He had just suffered a brain aneurysm that left him partially paralyzed on the left side, and unable to see, walk, or talk. He was spoonfed to the end of his life on February 17, 1998. Following this injury, Michigan's Athletic Board of Control temporarily suspended Toughman competition, but later allowed it to resume with some modifications. No cause for the aneurysm was ever officially announced."; ;Original Toughman;Brain injury;Ring;No determination;;

An hour later, he collapsed into a coma. He was taken to the hospital, where he died a few hours later. Cause of death was listed as massive contusion of the brain. Francis Walker, executive secretary of the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission, told reporters this was the first time a Pennsylvania amateur had died of ring injuries. Actually, there had been at least nine previous amateur boxing deaths in Pennsylvania. These included Bliss (1922), Maham (1927), Wilson (1927), Horne (1930), Cusano (1943), Mastrey (1945), George (1946),  Johnson (1953), and Velazquez (1963).";Regional Golden Gloves;Amateur;Brain injury;Soon after;; ;

The event was the First Annual Central Pennsylvania Tough Man Contest. Despite weighing just 169 pounds, Miller fought in the heavyweight division. He knocked out his first opponent on Friday, but afterwards, told his uncle that he was having headaches and was seeing double. He decided to continue fighting, however, because he was unemployed, and desperately wanted the $500 prize money. In the second fight, the fight was stopped in the second after Miller began throwing up in the ring. He collapsed in the dressing room, so his family took him to the hospital, where he died. Cause of death was brain hemorrhage. Early Toughman bouts were two minutes in length, with no headgear, but due to calls from Pennsylvania congressman John Murtha to ban Toughman, promoter Art Dore began to require participants to wear headgear. As noted above, Original Toughman dates to 1979, and this is its first known fatality. Its next serious injury appears to have been 35-year-old Jesse Cortez, who needed emergency brain surgery following a bout in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 1981."; ;Original Toughman;Brain injury;Ring;; ;

Davis was a Navajo, and this was his first boxing tournament. During his second fight in the tournament, he collapsed, and he died in hospital five days later. Cause of death was a head injury. The case law arising from this death is Martinez v. U.S. Olympic Committee C.A. 10 (N.M.), 1986, 802 F. 2d 1275, 55 USLW 2216, 5 Fed. R. Serv. 3d 1253. The court's decision in this case was that the court lacked jurisdiction.

In Wiley's words, ""Kim was off-center, exhausted and facing Mancini's corner. He never saw the punch. Mancini drove off his right foot and delivered the first of the final pair of rights on the point of the Korean's chin. A glancing left hook followed, then a crushing right which sent Kim to the canvas. Kim landed heavily on his back and head, rolled over in slow motion, grabbed a middle strand of the ropes, and stared blankly at the timekeeper."" Kim died three days later, and both his mother and the referee subsequently committed suicide. As was (and is) usual in boxing-related fatalities, no autopsy was done. Nonetheless, Kim's death was the proximate cause of Nevada adopting a standing 8-count and a 45-day layoff for boxers knocked out. It was also the reason the World Boxing Council gave for reducing the length of championship fights from 15 rounds to 12 (though again, the hour-long limits of TV sports shows is more likely the true reason). A Korean film, Champion, was subsequently made of Kim's life and, unsurprisingly, it focused on Kim's courage rather than his death. Korea Times, June 28, 2002, http://korealink.co.kr/kt_culture/200206/t2002062820341146110.htm. For his part, Mancini just kept boxing.

NOTE: This is a possible PFO death, as patent foramen ovale, or PFO, is the cause of 25-50% of all strokes in people aged under 50 years. PFO specifically refers to a small hole in the heart that everyone has at birth, and that usually closes up within a few years. If it does not close up, it usually causes no problems. However, in rare instances, PFO can allow small clots to pass through, and these clots can in turn lead to strokes.

After the fight, Gross spoke with reporters, and then, about 90 minutes later, he collapsed in the dressing room. He lapsed into a coma, and he died of injuries on January 28, 1990. Cause of death was subdural hematoma on the left side of the brain. In the interim, Gross's family applied for workers' compensation. In 1990, an administrative law judge ruled that Gross had a valid claim and that the family was eligible for survivors' benefits. The State Insurance Fund appealed this decision, and in 1997, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed the lower courts. That is, the appeals court ruled that professional boxers were ineligible for workers' compensation through the State Fund. The court's reasoning was that the plain language of the Workers' Compensation Law specifically excluded ""compensation for any injury occasioned 'by wilful intention of the injured employee to bring about the injury or death of himself or another,'' and that ""it would be absurd to suggest that he [Gross] participated in that match without willfully intending to bring about the injury of his opponent."" The justices ruled 2-1 on this, and in his dissenting opinion, the dissenting justice wrote, in part, that ""denying compensation to an entire class of athletes... is not, we think, what the Legislature contemplated."" The case law is Estate of Gross v. Three Rivers Inn Inc., 238 A.D. 2d 12, 667 N.Y.S. 2d 71, 1997 N.Y. Slip Op. 11247. The split decision promptly led to another court case, namely 92 N.Y. 2d 970, 706 N.E. 2d 741, 683 N.Y.S. 2d 753, 1998, N.Y.

Stone left the ring unaided. Afterwards, on his way home, he complained of feeling sick. Once home, he went into the bathroom and did not come out. His mother called an ambulance. Before the ambulance arrived, his heart stopped. Friends and relatives gave heart massage. His heart resumed beating, and the ambulance took him to the hospital, where surgery was done. Nonetheless, he died two days later. Cause of death was subdural hematoma. The death led to calls for the use of MRI scans of all boxers who were knocked out, for weigh-ins to be held at least 24 hours in advance, so fighters would not be dehydrated. The coroner's jury ruled death by misadventure. This is probably the boxing brain injury described in J.F. Geddes, G.H. Vowles, S.F. Robinson, and J.C.

Just two tired guys mustering the occasional strength to punch at each other."" Between the second and third rounds, Sizemore leaned on the ropes, spit out his mouthguard, and vomited. He said his head hurt. The referee stopped the fight, and his friends took Sizemore to the dressing room. From there, he was transported to the hospital, where he died on March 9. The state boxing administrator, Jim Hall, stated publicly that Sizemore's death might have been due to cocaine. However, the autopsy revealed no cocaine. Instead, the medical examiner said death was due to blows to the head. There had been no physician ringside; at the time of this fight, the doctor was in the dressing room, examining other fighters. The subsequent public uproar contributed to Hall's termination as state boxing administrator and to the closing of Rough Guy Inc.

This is the first known death of a female pugilist in modern times. It was Young's first fight, and she entered because the other female entrant needed an opponent. Young's husband and 9-year-old daughter were in the audience. During the first round, she was hit hard, and in the second, she was hit hard some more. During the third round, Young tried to retreat to her corner, but the referee did not stop the fight and the announcer, Art Dore, only said, ""Only a few seconds to go, ladies."" Young was knocked out, and she subsequently died in hospital from swelling and bleeding in the brain. Within a year, the public furor surrounding this death led to the enactment of the Stacy Young Act of 2004 (Section 548.008, Florida Statutes), which stated that no amateur boxing or kickboxing match could be held in Florida unless it was first sanctioned by an organization approved by the Florida Boxing Commission. Related court cases included American Boxing & Athletic Ass'n, Inc. v. Young, 911 So. 2d 862 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 2005), http://www.2dca.org/opinion/September%2023,%202005/2D04-3394.pdf.  In this latter case, the widower, who had been knocked out himself during the same show during which his wife died, brought suit for wrongful death in a Florida court. The promoter's attorney promptly filed for change of venue to Bay City, Michigan, based upon a stipulation in the pre-fight release form. The Superior Court judge dismissed that argument, saying that it inconvenienced everyone but the promoter. The promoter promptly appealed. The appelate judges said the lower court's decision was correct, but for the wrong reason. To the higher court, the correct reason was not convenience, but the wording of the release form. Thus, while disputes relating to the wording of the release document itself would have to be held in Bay City, Michigan, the matter of wrongful death could be heard in Florida.

Rone, who weighed 259 pounds and had high blood pressure, took a hard kidney punch a few seconds before the end of the first round. Between rounds, Rone collapsed in his corner, and he was pronounced dead at the hospital.  Cause of death was listed as idiopathic cardiac arrhythmia caused by exertion. Because Rone collapsed between rounds, the fight was officially listed as no contest rather than loss by knockout. When Rone took the fight, his record was approximately 7-41-3, with 25 straight losses, 12 of them by knockout. Rone took the fight on 24-hour notice, apparently because he needed the $800 purse to pay for his mother's funeral.

Nonetheless, the family's wrongful death suit against the Utah Athletic Commission was dismissed in February 2006, a ruling that the state Supreme Court upheld in December 2007.

Carty was a trooper trainee at the Texas State Police academy. He and a training partner (another recruit) boxed for about eight minutes during a drill called ""active countermeasures."" The recruits were wearing gloves, chest pads, and headgear, and told to fight as if their lives depended on the outcome. Carty was knocked down at least twice during eight minutes of boxing and finally, he collapsed. He was transported to the hospital, where brain surgery was done. He died a week later. Cause of death was brain injury. Although the academy blamed faulty equipment rather than inadequate supervision, Dudley Thomas, a retired colonel in Texas Department of Public Safety, noted that the boxing was often used to weed out low-performing students. Moreover, subsequent investigation determined that 121 Texas State Police recruits had suffered concussions during active countermeasures training since the program began in 1978, and that two of these injuries had been near-fatal (one in 1978 and a second in 1988). In addition, the overall rate of serious head injury during the academy's active countermeasures training was about 1.1%, whereas an equivalent federal training program had about one serious head injury per 50,000 trainees. The family's lawsuits led to changes in defensive tactics programs in the Texas Department of Public Safety, and to the California-based Kim Pacific Martial Arts (the maker of the allegedly faulty protective equipment) paying $800,000 to Carty's estate; see Case 2:06-cv-00138-TJW Document 126 filed 09/25/2007 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division, http://www.websupp.org/data/EDTX/2:06-cv-00138-126-EDTX.pdf.
